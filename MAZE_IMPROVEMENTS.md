# Pacman Maze Improvements

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the Pacman maze to ensure perfect symmetry and complete accessibility of all pellets.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Symmetry Problems
- The original maze was not horizontally symmetrical
- Several rows had asymmetrical wall/path configurations
- This affected game balance and visual aesthetics

### 2. Accessibility Issues
- Some dots were generated in areas not reachable from Pacman's starting position
- Tunnel entrance positions created isolated path segments
- Power pellets needed verification for accessibility

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Maze Structure Fixes

#### Symmetrical Layout
- **Fixed rows 7 and 11 (tunnel rows)**: Changed from irregular patterns to perfectly symmetrical tunnel configurations
- **Ensured mirror symmetry**: Every cell at position (x, y) now matches its mirror at (width-1-x, y)
- **Maintained classic Pacman design**: Preserved the traditional maze elements while ensuring symmetry

#### Accessibility Improvements
- **Tunnel connections**: Properly configured horizontal tunnels on rows 7 and 11
- **Path connectivity**: Ensured all playable areas connect to Pacman's starting position (10, 15)
- **Ghost house integration**: Maintained proper ghost house connectivity

### 2. Enhanced Dot Generation Logic

```typescript
// Improved dot generation excludes:
- Pacman starting position (10, 15)
- Ghost house area (9-11, 8-11)
- Power pellet positions (1,3), (19,3), (1,17), (19,17)
- Tunnel entrances (0,7), (20,7), (0,11), (20,11)
```

### 3. Comprehensive Validation System

#### Created Analysis Tools
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Validates all positions reachable from Pacman's start
- **Symmetry checker**: Verifies horizontal mirror symmetry
- **Accessibility validator**: Ensures all collectibles are reachable

#### Test Suite
- **Automated testing**: Node.js script for comprehensive maze validation
- **Visual verification**: Interactive React component for maze analysis
- **Statistics reporting**: Detailed metrics on maze properties

## Validation Results
