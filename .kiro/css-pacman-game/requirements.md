# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The CSS-only Pacman game is an innovative implementation of the classic arcade game using only HTML and CSS technologies, without any JavaScript. This project demonstrates the power of modern CSS features including animations, transforms, and pseudo-selectors to create interactive gameplay. The game will feature smooth animations, engaging visual feedback, and a faithful recreation of core Pacman mechanics while pushing the boundaries of what's possible with pure CSS.

The game will include essential Pacman elements: a maze layout, player-controlled Pacman character, collectible dots, power pellets, and animated ghost enemies. All interactions and animations will be achieved through CSS hover states, checkbox hacks, radio button selections, and keyframe animations to simulate traditional game mechanics without scripting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Game Board and Maze Layout
**User Story:** As a player, I want a visually appealing maze layout that resembles the classic Pacman game, so that I can navigate through familiar pathways and corridors.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL display a rectangular maze with walls, pathways, and corners
2. WHEN viewing the maze THEN the system SHALL show distinct visual styling for walls (solid blocks) versus pathways (open spaces)
3. WHEN the game initializes THEN the system SHALL position dots throughout all navigable pathways
4. IF the maze is displayed THEN the system SHALL include four power pellets positioned in the corners of the maze
5. WHILE the game is active THE system SHALL maintain consistent maze boundaries that prevent characters from moving outside the play area

### Requirement 2: Pacman Character and Movement
**User Story:** As a player, I want to control Pacman's movement through the maze using keyboard inputs, so that I can navigate and collect dots.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display Pacman as a yellow circular character with an opening mouth
2. WHEN arrow keys are pressed THEN Pacman SHALL move in the corresponding direction (up, down, left, right)
3. WHEN Pacman moves THEN the system SHALL animate the mouth opening and closing to simulate eating
4. IF Pacman encounters a wall THEN the system SHALL prevent movement in that direction
5. WHILE Pacman moves THE system SHALL rotate the character sprite to face the direction of movement
6. WHEN Pacman moves over a dot THEN the system SHALL remove the dot from the maze and increment the score

### Requirement 3: Ghost Enemies and AI Behavior
**User Story:** As a player, I want challenging ghost opponents that move through the maze, so that the game provides excitement and difficulty.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display four ghosts with distinct colors (red, pink, blue, orange)
2. WHEN the game is active THEN ghosts SHALL move automatically through the maze pathways
3. WHEN ghosts encounter walls THEN the system SHALL change their movement direction
4. IF a ghost collides with Pacman THEN the system SHALL trigger a game over state
5. WHILE power pellet is active THE ghosts SHALL change to a vulnerable blue color and flee from Pacman
6. WHEN Pacman collides with a vulnerable ghost THEN the system SHALL remove the ghost temporarily and award points

### Requirement 4: Scoring and Game Progression
**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my score increase as I collect dots and defeat ghosts, so that I can track my progress and compete for high scores.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN Pacman collects a regular dot THEN the system SHALL award 10 points
2. WHEN Pacman collects a power pellet THEN the system SHALL award 50 points
3. WHEN Pacman eats a vulnerable ghost THEN the system SHALL award 200 points
4. IF all dots are collected THEN the system SHALL display a victory state
5. WHILE the game is active THE system SHALL continuously display the current score
6. WHEN the game ends THEN the system SHALL show the final score prominently

### Requirement 5: Visual Design and Animations
**User Story:** As a player, I want smooth, engaging animations and polished visual design, so that the game feels professional and enjoyable to play.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any character moves THEN the system SHALL animate the movement smoothly without jerky transitions
2. WHEN Pacman eats THEN the system SHALL animate the mouth opening and closing at appropriate intervals
3. WHEN ghosts move THEN the system SHALL show subtle floating or oscillating animations
4. IF power mode is active THEN ghosts SHALL flash blue and white to indicate vulnerability time remaining
5. WHILE the game runs THE system SHALL use appropriate retro-style fonts and colors matching classic Pacman aesthetics
6. WHEN game states change THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback through color changes or scaling effects

### Requirement 6: CSS-Only Implementation Constraints
**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entire game functionality implemented using only HTML and CSS, so that it demonstrates advanced CSS capabilities without JavaScript dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN implementing controls THEN the system SHALL use CSS checkbox/radio button hacks for state management
2. WHEN creating animations THEN the system SHALL utilize CSS keyframes, transforms, and transitions exclusively
3. WHEN handling interactions THEN the system SHALL leverage CSS hover, focus, and pseudo-selector states
4. IF collision detection is needed THEN the system SHALL use CSS positioning and z-index layering techniques
5. WHILE maintaining game state THE system SHALL employ CSS counters and content generation where possible
6. WHEN styling elements THEN the system SHALL avoid any JavaScript event handlers or scripting
