# Visual-only enhancement summary

This change improves the look and feel of the React + TailwindCSS Pacman game without changing any gameplay logic or rules. All updates are presentational (styles, classes, theme tokens, and animation utilities).

## What changed

- Fonts & Title: Added retro arcade fonts via Google Fonts (Press Start 2P for headings, Share Tech Mono for numbers/body) and updated page title to "AI Pacman".
- Tailwind theme: Extended theme with
  - font families: `font-arcade`, `font-mono`
  - retro color tokens: pacman-yellow, maze-blue, and ghost colors
  - box shadows: neonBlue, neonYellow, neonRed, glass
  - keyframes/animations: float, flicker, glowPulse, shimmer (+ provided aliases)
- Global CSS utilities (src/index.css):
  - Background radial gradient and subtle CRT scanline overlay utility
  - `neon-frame` and `glass-panel` component classes
  - `bg-maze-grid` background pattern for the playfield
- Component restyling (classes only):
  - App.tsx header uses arcade font with neon glow; stats in a glass panel
  - GameBoard wraps the grid in a `neon-frame` with subtle grid backdrop
  - MazeCell walls now gradient/inner-shadow; dots/power pellets glow
  - Pacman has a constant glow + will-change transform for smoothness
  - Ghosts float subtly and keep vulnerable flashing; added soft glow
  - GameControls placed in glass panels (desktop) for a premium feel
  - Overlays (game over / victory) use neon frame and improved typography

## Files touched

- index.html (fonts + title)
- tailwind.config.js (theme extension)
- src/index.css (base + components layer)
- src/App.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/GameBoard.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/MazeCell.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/Pacman.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/Ghost.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/Dot.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/PowerPellet.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)
- src/components/GameControls.tsx (className-only visual tweaks)

## What did NOT change (important)

- No modifications to hooks or game logic (movement, collision detection, AI, scoring, power mode, etc.)
- No changes to types, interfaces, or exported APIs
- No structural changes to component hierarchies affecting state/props

## Accessibility & performance notes

- Animations rely on `transform` and `opacity`; heavy layout-changing properties avoided
- `will-change: transform` added for Pacman/Ghost to hint GPU acceleration
- Contrast preserved on dark backgrounds; focus rings retained on buttons

## Next steps / validation checklist

1. Dev run: `npm run dev` and play for a few minutes
   - Movement is smooth; no stutter
   - Keyboard: arrows/WASD + space to pause still works
   - Dots and power pellets collect and score updates
   - Ghost vulnerable flashing remains visible
   - Game over / victory overlays show correctly
2. Responsive checks: narrow viewport for mobile; confirm mobile controls unaffected
3. Lint/build: `npm run build` should succeed with no TypeScript/ESLint errors

## Task 6: Ghost Components and AI ✅

### 6.1 Ghost Component with TailwindCSS Styling ✅

**Location:** `src/components/Ghost.tsx`

**Features Implemented:**

## Issues Fixed

### Ghost Positioning Issue ✅
**Problem:** Ghosts were rendering outside the GameBoard container due to incorrect positioning logic.

**Solution:** 
- Updated Ghost component to use the same grid-aligned positioning system as Pacman
- Implemented responsive design with separate calculations for small/large screens
- Used proper cell centering calculations accounting for container padding and gaps
- Moved ghost rendering inside GameBoard component for proper containment

**Technical Changes:**
- Modified `Ghost.tsx` to match Pacman's positioning system with `getCellCenter()` calculations
- Updated `GameBoard.tsx` to accept and render ghosts within the maze container
- Removed separate ghost rendering from `App.tsx` and `TestApp.tsx`
- Ensured ghosts align perfectly with the grid cells and move smoothly

## Recent Fixes Applied ✅

### Issue: Pacman Not Moving When Arrow Keys Pressed
**Problem:** Pacman would not start moving when direction keys were pressed, only changing direction.

**Root Cause:** The `handleDirectionChange` function only called `setDirection()` but didn't call `startMoving()` to begin movement.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `handleDirectionChange` in both `App.tsx` and `TestApp.tsx`
- Added automatic `startMoving()` call when direction changes and Pacman isn't already moving
- Now follows classic Pacman behavior: pressing any direction key starts movement

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Added `startMoving()` call in `handleDirectionChange`
- `src/TestApp.tsx`: Added `startMoving()` call in `handleDirectionChange`

### Issue: Ghosts Too Large Compared to Pacman
**Problem:** Ghosts were rendered at full cell size (24px/32px) while Pacman was smaller (16px/22px), making ghosts appear oversized.

**Solution:**
- Updated Ghost component sizing to match Pacman exactly:
  - Small screens: 16px (was 24px)
  - Large screens: 22px (was 32px)
- Adjusted positioning calculations to center ghosts properly with new sizes
- Ghosts now have the same visual weight and proportion as Pacman

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Ghost.tsx`: Updated width/height and positioning calculations

### Testing Infrastructure Added
**Quick Test Mode:** Created `src/QuickTest.tsx` for rapid testing of fixes:
- Simple test environment focusing on movement and sizing
- Real-time feedback on Pacman position and movement state
- Side-by-side ghost comparison (normal vs vulnerable)
- Easy access via `QUICK_TEST = true` in `main.tsx`

**Development Mode Switcher:** Enhanced `src/main.tsx` with three modes:
- `QUICK_TEST`: Simple movement and sizing verification
- `DEVELOPMENT_MODE`: Full comprehensive testing suite
- Production mode: Standard game application

## Verification ✅
Both fixes have been applied and tested:
- ✅ Pacman now starts moving immediately when arrow keys are pressed
- ✅ Ghosts are now the same size as Pacman (16px small, 22px large)
- ✅ All positioning remains accurate within the maze grid
- ✅ Build compiles successfully with no errors
- ✅ Quick test mode available for immediate verification

### Issue: Console Error - Maximum Update Depth Exceeded
**Problem:** React was throwing "Maximum update depth exceeded" error due to infinite re-renders caused by circular dependencies in useEffect.

**Root Cause:** The `powerPelletSystem` object was included in useEffect dependency arrays, but this object was being recreated on every render due to inline callback functions.

**Solution:** 
- Removed `powerPelletSystem` from useEffect dependency arrays in all components
- Added `useMemo` to memoize power pellet system callbacks and prevent object recreation
- Optimized ghost AI configuration with memoized callbacks and shared config object
- Only kept the specific reactive values in dependencies: `powerMode.isActive` and `isFlashingPhase`

**Files Modified:**
- `src/App.tsx`: Memoized callbacks and optimized ghost AI configuration
- `src/TestApp.tsx`: Fixed useEffect dependencies
- `src/components/GhostIntegrationDemo.tsx`: Fixed useEffect dependencies

**Performance Improvements:**
- Eliminated infinite re-render loop
- Reduced unnecessary ghost AI hook recreations
- Better React performance with proper memoization patterns
- Console errors resolved ✅

### Issue: Maze Analysis Location
**Change:** Moved "Show Maze Analysis" functionality from main App.tsx to TestApp.tsx for better organization.

**Rationale:**
- Main App.tsx should focus on core gameplay
- TestApp.tsx is the comprehensive testing environment
- Maze analysis is a development/testing tool, not a gameplay feature

**Implementation:**
- Added new `maze-analysis` test mode to TestApp.tsx
- Imported `MazeVisualization` component into TestApp
- Removed maze analysis toggle and state from main App.tsx
- Added "Maze Analysis" button to TestApp mode selector
- Cleaned up main App to focus purely on gameplay

**Files Modified:**
- `src/TestApp.tsx`: Added maze analysis as 5th test mode
- `src/App.tsx`: Removed maze analysis functionality, simplified to pure game
- `src/main.tsx`: Updated to show TestApp by default with new mode info

**Result:**
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns between game and testing
- ✅ TestApp now has 5 modes: Full Game, Power Demo, Ghost Demo, AI Showcase, Maze Analysis
- ✅ Main App is streamlined for pure gameplay experience
- ✅ Better developer experience with organized testing tools

The foundation for ghost AI and power mechanics is now solid and ready for integration with the remaining game systems.
